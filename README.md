# Angular FizzBuzz
Angular 8 FizzBuzz website built using the Material Dashboard Angular theme.

### Prerequisites

After cloning the repo be sure to run npm i to get all the relevant packages

## Getting Started

You can serve the solution with ng serve and you can access the site by browsing to http://localhost:4200. 
Once the site is open you will be presented with the dashboard page with the core fizzbuzz functionality.

Currently you can only change the rules by altering the dashboard component directly. If you open src>app>dashboard>dashboard.component.ts you will find the fizzBangRules initalised during the ngOnInit event

## ToDo

- ~~Create FizzBuzz component to store logic~~
- ~~Allow alteration of rule set via UI~~
- Allow alteration of core game config via UI
- Add ability to re-order rules
