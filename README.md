# Angular FizzBuzz
Angular 8 FizzBuzz website built using the Material Dashboard Angular theme.

### Prerequisites

After cloning the repo be sure to run npm i to get all the relevant packages

## Getting Started

You can serve the solution with ng serve and you can access the site by browsing to http://localhost:4200. 
Once the site is open you will be presented with the dashboard page with the core fizzbuzz functionality.

Currently there is no way to edit a existing rule, you will need to delete the rule and re-create it using the on screen UI.

Optionally, you can also get the sibling project https://github.com/LWhitlocke/AngularFizzBuzz.Api for a live API example. This is not required and the app will utilise a local datasource if the http call fails.

## ToDo

- ~~Create FizzBuzz component to store logic~~
- ~~Allow alteration of rule set via UI~~
- ~~Get game rules from API~~
- ~~Allow alteration of core game config via UI~~
- Add second sample game
- Add ability to edit existing rules
- Add ability to re-order rules
